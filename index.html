                                        Pavol, a developer and tech enthusiast who is passionate about exploring
                                        cutting–edge tools and technologies. As a co–founder of H-edu and Collboard, I'm
                                        invested in using digital innovation to transform education. I've developed
                                        several citizen science projects, including the first mobile app for
                                        birdwatchers in the Czech Republic, and spoken at tech and startup conferences
                                        on topics such as VR, AR and AI. I also run Czech.events, a platform that helps
                                        people find and attend technology and innovation events. My talent for
                                        identifying growth opportunities and mentoring startups has led me to win
                                        several innovation competitions. I'm committed to inspiring others and believe
                                        that technology can help solve the world's problems.
