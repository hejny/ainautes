                                                Pavol built a prototype of our H-edu app so that we could get immediate investment. He then designed the architecture of the system and the use of the technology, which proved to be the right
                                                choice for our proved to be the right choice for our purposes. In the early days of covid-19, responded very well to the teaching needs of the teachers and in record time created exactly the

                                                Pavol is an absolute beast when it comes to creating digital products. I've seen him – literally overnight – create an integrated chatbot that won us the 1st place at Startup Weekend Prague.

                                            <p>He learns any topic or technology quickly and builds even faster, with exceptional usability.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                I'd recommend Pavol to everyone who wants to see real life results in a manageable time frame.<br />
                                                Plus he's really considerate, kind and a pleasure to work with.
