Steps from Aiai page to exported page:
*(That I have done manually for Ainautes)*

- Add `<!DOCTYPE html>` to the top of the page
- Fix images
- Fix footer
- Extract style for fonts
- Extract style config
- Cleanup style config
- Cleanup next relicts (like /_next/static/...)
- Go through all the unused css vars and remove them
- Go through all the unused fonts vars and remove them
- Go through all the unused classes vars and remove them
- Create basic script (folder structure like this)
- Embed wallpaper
- Embed patterns
- Upscale wallpaper (manually)
- Upscaled wallpaper to srcset
- Add creator metadata + signature in Footer + README.md
- Add <meta name="theme-color" content="..." />
- Add CNAME (according to export domain)
- Check all the links
- Make favicon
- Make manifest
- Make robots.txt
- Make sitemap.xml
- Make .htaccess
- Make .nojekyll

And several other steps (which can be already done before export):
